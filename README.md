# Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) in India using regression models and time series data on pollutant levels. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to raise awareness about air pollution, support public health initiatives, and inform environmental policy decisions.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and compiled by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), includes pollutant measurements like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and SO2 for various Indian cities from 2015 to 2020. The analysis focuses on the city_day subset of the dataset.
